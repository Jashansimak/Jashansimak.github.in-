Subject	Math

Today we had a maths class with Mam Sandeep kaur. Her class was engaging and smooth. I made a silly mistake in a solution, and she didn’t react negatively at all. Instead, she told me to take another look and figure it out, which I appreciate. Her personality is so welcoming and approachable, which made me feel relaxed in class. Her openness to questions and her willingness to help out make her a great teacher.

A good state of mind is key to a fulfilling life it’s up to us to create our own heaven or hell.
Harmony start with self /family/ society/nature 
We should focus on our natural acceptance regardless of our preconditioning.
Self exploration leads to deeper understanding of oneself and can help us navigate life with harmony.
Physical facilities should only serve the function of prosperity and not to convey a sense of inferiority.
Any pourposal with Human beings should give us Mutual Harmony and any pourposal with Nature should give us Mutual prosperity.

Header important points 
The lamp continues to illuminate its surroundings, even as it burns itself out.
The knowledge we aquire throughout life, the lessons we learn, the experiences we accumulate, are all parts of a precious inheritance that we pass on to the generations to follow.
The tree graciously bears fruit, yet does not taste its own bounty; the pond reflects the sky above, yet never quenches its own thirst.
Even a damp log of wood can be ignited.
In this world, everyone has experienced failure. Therefore, we should not feel ashamed of our failures; rather, we should learn from them.
These woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.
We shouldn’t engage in challenges with the intention of bringing others down.
Don’t become enslaved by ‘what ifs’.

The English activity class was a dynamic and challenging experience that engaged our critical thinking skills.
The quiz consisted of 5 rounds between Team A (CSC) and Team B (CSD).
Through a series of quizzes, we had the opportunity to learn new vocabulary and idioms, and test our knowledge in a fun and competitive setting. The activity also fostered a sense of camaraderie among our teammates, as we worked together to answer the questions and succeed in the challenges. Overall, it was an exciting experience.

 The second English activity was another great opportunity to test our knowledge of general knowledge and daily affairs. The quiz was designed to challenge us, but this time, we were given the freedom to choose our own teams.
I was in the Team A. Even thought the team didn’t win, the experience was rewarding in many other ways, we were able to build strong bonds and make friends, which is just as valuable as winning the quiz.

Today I learned about three different learning techniques: surface, deep, and strategic learning. Our instructor, Dr. Pushpinder Singh, emphasized the importance of using deep and strategic learning in college to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Dr. Pushpinder explained how different people have different learning styles and that forcing one method on all students may lead to them disliking the subject. He also talked about the importance of competition with oneself rather than others, as well as being focused, flexible, humble, and having faith in one’s abilities.
